      <h3>Jimmy Boozers' Story</h3>
      
<pre><p>It's another Sunday and today I have purpose. The big Dundee vs Rangers match is on and I need to find a dirty boozer to watch it.

I've been to the Cock Tavern before. The first time was mental. The old firm were on and a sea of hoops filled the place, along with a pungent alkaline smell from the stained fabric seats. The Cock Tavern is an Irish pub and has a heavy following from London Celtic fans. On that particular day Rangers won the match, and outside post-match, a taxi drove past waving a Union Jack and Rangers scarves. Pint glasses and bottles were hurled and lads chased the taxi down the street. Anyway, as a Dundee fan, in my mind Celtic fans would be supporting Dundee today. So I set off in search for Valhalla.

A dilapidated looking old building around the back of Kings Cross spells out the words " OCK  T VERN", missing several letters. Promising. This is it.

Upon entry I can see the game is on, but no one is watching it. There is also some rugby on but no one is watching that either. Think it's an Irish rugby match which is maybe why it's on. Anyway I get myself a pint and park in front of the Dundee Rangers screen. 

The Decor is old school classic DB. There are a few regulars propped up at the bar. A couple of very young whippersnappers knocking about giving the set up a nice family vibe. Then there's the local legend, Gilly. Gilly is Scottish like me but I can't understand a single word he is saying. You can tell he's knocked back a fair few in his time and has a story or 2 to tell. It's just a pity I wouldn't be able to understand any of them. I think he might be partially deaf as well as everyone is repeating themselves at least twice when speaking to him. Anyway Gilly knows everyone here and commands respect.

Some very old boys fill the perimeter in their regular seats. I get a particularly dodgy stare when one old boy stumbles in, I must be in his seat, and I feel bad. But this place was saved by such heroes. In fact the gentlemen in the main picture (credit camdennewjournal) fought to keep the venue afloat, despite pressure from money grabbing re-developers. Such community effort comes hand in hand with the ethos of the dirty boozer and deserves applause. Through these guys efforts and others pubs like this remain open and I salute them.

The game is 1-1 but Dundee but have had a boy sent off in the 20th minute so are doing alright. Kenny Miller is still running around like a lunatic. The big man's 39 but is still prancing about like a gazelle on speed. He obviously doesn't drink so unfortunately won't be joining me down the Cock Tavern anytime soon.

Guinness £3.50
Lager £3.50 (Carling)
Decent.
Cash only no cards accepted. Flash an AMEX at your own risk but prepared to be laughed.

Football on - 2 sport options by the looks of it.

Just as I'm about to set off a large young team strut in confidently. About 30 of them all in their early 20s. Its good. It gives me hope for the future of the boozer. They can see beyond the overpriced pretentiousness of the modern day hipster bistro. You can get a reasonably priced pint here and watch the football. I commend them.

Gilly's now dancing with one of the wee kids. The wee man trying and failing to teach Gilly how to floss. Gilly just about manages to stay on his feet. Valiant effort Gilly.

<strong><u>Summary</u>
Extremely friendly and efficient service and a good vibe.  Good value. Give it a chance.

Expect it to be quite busy if Celtic are playing. Expect it to be extremely busy if Celtic are playing rangers.

Quality Boozer.</strong></p></pre>
